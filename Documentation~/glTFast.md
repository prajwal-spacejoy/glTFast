# glTFast Documentation

*glTFast* enables loading [glTF 3D](https://www.khronos.org/gltf) asset files in [Unity](https://unity.com).

It focuses on speed, memory efficiency and a small build footprint.

Try the [WebGL Demo][gltfast-web-demo] and check out the [demo project](https://github.com/atteneder/glTFastDemo).

## Features

*glTFast* supports runtime loading of glTF 2.0 files.

It supports large parts of the glTF 2.0 specification plus many extensions and runs on following platforms:

- WebGL
- iOS
- Android
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Universal Windows Platform

It is planned to become feature complete. Most notable missing features are:

- No animations
- No morph targets
- Unity's built-in render pipeline only (URP and HDRP are planned)

See the [list of features/extensions](./features.md) for details and limitations.

## Usage

You can load a glTF asset from an URL or a file path.

> Note: glTFs are loaded via [UnityWebRequests](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.html). File paths have to be prefixed with `file://` in the Unity Editor and on certain platforms (e.g. iOS).

### Load via Component

Add a `GltfAsset` component to a GameObject.

![GltfAsset component][gltfasset_component]

### Load via Script

```C#
var gltf = gameObject.AddComponent<GLTFast.GltfAsset>();
gltf.url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/master/2.0/Duck/glTF/Duck.gltf";
```

#### Load from byte array

In case you want to handle download/file loading yourself, you can load glTF binary files directly from C# byte[] like so:

```csharp
async void LoadGltfBinaryFromMemory() {
    byte[] data = File.ReadAllBytes("/path/to/file.glb");
    var gltf = new GLTFast();
    bool success = await gltf.LoadGltfBinary(data, new Uri(m_Path));
    if (success) {
        success = gltf.InstantiateGltf(transform);
    }
}
```

> Note: Most users want to load self-contained glTF binary files this way, but `LoadGltfBinary` also takes the original URI of glTF file as second parameter, so it can resolve relative URIs.

### Customize loading behavior

Loading via script allows you to:

- Custom download or file loading behaviour (see [`IDownloadProvider`](../Runtime/Scripts/IDownload.cs))
- Custom material generation (see [`IMaterialGenerator`](../Runtime/Scripts/IMaterialGenerator.cs))
- Customize [instantiation](#Instantiation)
- Load glTF once and instantiate it many times (see example [below](#custom-post-loading-Script))
- Access data of glTF scene (for example get material; see example [below](#custom-post-loading-Script))
- Tweak and optimize loading performance

#### Custom Post-Loading Script

In case you want to trigger custom logic when loading finished, add an event callback:

```C#
async void Start() {
    // First step: load glTF
    var gltf = new GLTFast.GLTFast();
    var success = await gltf.Load("file:///path/to/file.gltf");

    if (success) {
        // Here you can customize the post-loading behavior
        
        // Get the first material
        var material = gltf.GetMaterial();
        Debug.LogFormat("The first material is called {0}", material.name);

        // Instantiate the scenes multiple times
        gltf.InstantiateGltf( new GameObject("Instance 1").transform );
        gltf.InstantiateGltf( new GameObject("Instance 2").transform );
        gltf.InstantiateGltf( new GameObject("Instance 3").transform );
    } else {
        Debug.LogError("Loading glTF failed!");
    }
}
```

#### Instantiation

Creating actual GameObjects (or Entities) from the imported data (Meshes, Materials) is called instantiation.

You can customize it by providing an implementation of `IInstantiator` ( see [source](./Runtime/Scripts/IInstatiator.cs) and the reference implementation [`GameObjectInstantiator`](./Runtime/Scripts/GameObjectInstantiator.cs) for details).

Inject your custom instantiation like so

```csharp
public class YourCustomInstantiator : GLTFast.IInstantiator {
  // Your code here
}
…

  // In your custom post-loading script, use it like this
  gltfAsset.InstantiateGltf( new YourCustomInstantiator() );
```

#### Tune loading performance

When loading glTFs, *glTFast* let's you optimize for two diametrical extremes

- A stable frame rate
- Fastest loading time

By default each `GltfAsset` instance tries not to block the main thread for longer than a certain time budget and defer the remaining loading process to the next frame / game loop iteration.

If you load many glTF files at once, by default they won't be aware of each other and collectively might block the main game loop for too long.

You can solve this by using a common "defer agent". It decides if work should continue right now or at the next game loop iteration. *glTFast* comes with two defer agents

- `TimeBudgetPerFrameDeferAgent` for stable frame rate
- `UninterruptedDeferAgent` for fastest, uninterrupted loading

Usage example

```C#
async void CustomDeferAgent() {
    // Recommended: Use a common defer agent across multiple GLTFast instances!
    // For a stable frame rate:
    IDeferAgent deferAgent = gameObject.AddComponent<TimeBudgetPerFrameDeferAgent>();
    // Or for faster loading:
    deferAgent = new UninterruptedDeferAgent();

    var tasks = new List<Task>();
    
    foreach( var url in manyUrls) {
        var gltf = new GLTFast.GLTFast(null,deferAgent);
        var task = gltf.Load(url).ContinueWith(t => {
            if (t.Result) {
                gltf.InstantiateGltf(transform);
            }
        });
        tasks.Add(task);
    }

    await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
}
```

> Note 1: Depending on your glTF scene, using the `UninterruptedDeferAgent` may block the main thread for up to multiple seconds. Be sure to not do this during critical game play action.

> Note2 : Using the `TimeBudgetPerFrameDeferAgent` does **not** guarantee a stutter free frame rate. This is because some sub tasks of the loading routine (like uploading a texture to the GPU) may take too long, cannot be interrupted and **have** to be done on the main thread.

## Project Setup

### Materials and Shader Variants

❗ IMPORTANT ❗

glTF materials might require many shader/features combinations. You **have** to make sure all shader variants your project will ever use are included, or the materials will not work in builds (even if they work in the Editor).

*glTFast* uses custom shaders that are derived from the Unity Standard shaders (and have a similar big number of variants). Including all those variants can make your build big. There's an easy way to find the right subset, if you already know what files you'll expect:

- Run your scene that loads all glTFs you expect in the editor.
- Go to Edit->Project Settings->Graphics
- At the bottom end you'll see the "Shader Preloading" section
- Save the currently tracked shaders/variants to an asset
- Take this ShaderVariantCollection asset and add it to the "Preloaded Shaders" list

An alternative way is to create placeholder materials for all feature combinations you expect and put them in a "Resource" folder in your project.

Read the documentation about [`Shader.Find`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Shader.Find.html) for details how to include shaders in builds.

### Readable Mesh Data

By default glTFast discards mesh data after it was uploaded to the GPU to free up main memory (see [`markNoLongerReadable`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mesh.UploadMeshData.html)). You can disable this globally by using the scripting define `GLTFAST_KEEP_MESH_DATA`.

Motivations for this might be using meshes as physics colliders amongst [other cases](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mesh-isReadable.html).

## Implementation details

*glTFast* uses [Unity's JsonUtility](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/JsonUtility.html) for parsing, which has little overhead, is fast and memory-efficient (See <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JSONSerialization.html>).

It also uses fast low-level memory copy methods, [Unity's Job system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JobSystem.html) and the [Advanced Mesh API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mesh.html).
